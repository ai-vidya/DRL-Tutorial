# Deep Reinforcement Learning using TensorFlow

## ** The Material on this site and github would be updated in following months before and during the conference.

## Abstract

In the recent years, there has been increased interest in the field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), fuelled mainly by its performance in Atari Games and the win of AlphaGo over Mr. Lee Sedol, a Dan 9 Go player. Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not require labeled data. Here the agent learns through its interaction with the environment.  DRL combines the deep learning for sensory processing along with reinforcement learning algorithms. This tutorial introduces some of the most popular and successful DRL algorithms. We will start with an introduction to different learning paradigms and how DRL differs from them. We will also introduce the OpenAI reinforcement learning environment. The two major RL methods: value-based methods and policy-based methods will be explored. We will cover the Deep Q Network and use it to solve a discrete action space environment. Policy gradient methods will also be explored with a special emphasis on continuous action space and multi-agent environment. Finally, we will cover the pros and cons of different algorithms and proposed variations in them. The Tutorial will end with some open research problems in the field of DRL.

## Duration: Half day (3 hours, 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes break)

## Tutorial Objectives

* The tutorial is aimed at research students and machine learning/deep learning engineers with experience in supervised learning.  
* The audience will gain knowledge of the latest algorithms used in reinforcement learning.
* The tutorial will use OpenAI environment for training the agent and TensorFlow deep learning framework.
